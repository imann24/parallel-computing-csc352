Outside of a dog, 
a book is a man's best friend. 
Inside of a dog it's too dark to read. 
--Groucho Marx

The secret of life 
is honesty and fair dealing. 
If you can fake that, 
you've got it made. 
--Groucho Marx

Those are my principles, 
and if you don't like them... 
well, I have others. 
--Groucho Marx

Please accept my resignation. 
I don't care to belong to any club 
that will have me as a member.
--Groucho Marx
